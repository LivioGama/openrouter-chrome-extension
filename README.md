[![Bun](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-Bun-orange.svg)](https://bun.sh)

Hey there! ðŸ¦¾ This handy Chrome extension adds an "Group by Model" button to your OpenRouter Activity page so you can quickly see how much you're spending per AI model on that exported CSV data. Perfect for keeping track of your AI costs!

## âœ¨ What it does

- **One-click analysis**: Just click "Group by Model" next to your export button
- **Cost breakdown**: Shows you exactly how much each AI model is costing you
- **Developer-friendly**: Built with TypeScript and includes cool dev features like caching
- **Super easy to use**: Works right on the OpenRouter site - no extra steps needed

## ðŸš€ Automated Publishing

This extension uses GitHub Actions to automatically publish updates to the Chrome Web Store on every push to the `main` branch (excluding documentation-only changes).

### Setup Automated Publishing

1. **Create Google API Credentials:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Enable the Chrome Web Store API
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop Application)
   - Download the credentials as `oauth_client.json` and place it in your project root
   - Generate a refresh token using the OAuth flow:

     **Option A: Use the automated JSON helper script (easiest):**
     ```bash
     bun run generate-token:json
     ```
     (Automatically opens browser, captures callback, and generates refresh token)

     **Manual steps (if needed):**
     1. Visit: `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chromewebstore&redirect_uri=http://localhost&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID`
     2. Sign in and authorize (you'll be redirected to http://localhost)
     3. Copy the authorization code from the URL (it will look like: `http://localhost/?code=YOUR_CODE_HERE`)
     4. Exchange for tokens:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token \
       -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
       -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&code=AUTH_CODE&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=http://localhost"
     ```
     5. Copy the `refresh_token` from the response

2. **Get Extension ID:**
   - Go to [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard)
   - Find your extension's Item ID

3. **Add GitHub Secrets:**
   Go to your repository Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions â†’ New repository secret

   Add these secrets:
   - `CHROME_EXTENSION_ID`: Your extension's Item ID
   - `CHROME_CLIENT_ID`: OAuth Client ID
   - `CHROME_CLIENT_SECRET`: OAuth Client Secret
   - `CHROME_REFRESH_TOKEN`: OAuth Refresh Token

4. **Create Production Environment:**
   Go to Settings â†’ Environments â†’ New environment (name: `production`)

### Publishing Process

**Automatic Publishing:**
The extension automatically publishes on every push to `main` branch that includes code changes (excluding documentation-only updates).

1. **Make your code changes**
2. **Push to main branch:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **GitHub Actions will automatically:**
   - Build the extension
   - Create a ZIP archive
   - Upload to Chrome Web Store
   - Store the build artifact for manual download

4. **Submit for Review (when ready):**
   - Go to [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard)
   - Find your extension and click "Submit for Review"

**Note:** Every push to main will create a new draft version. Only submit for review when you're ready to publish.

### Manual Release Commands

```bash
# Build and commit changes
bun run release

# Create and push version tag (triggers auto-publish)
bun run release:tag

# Setup Google API credentials (step-by-step guide)
bun run setup:api

# Generate refresh token from oauth_client.json (automated - easiest)
bun run generate-token
```

### Testing Your Setup

1. **Test locally first:**
   ```bash
   bun run build
   # Check that dist/ folder contains your extension files
   ```

2. **Test the workflow:**
   ```bash
   # Make a small change (add a comment to any file)
   git add .
   git commit -m "Test automated publishing"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Check GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to your repository â†’ Actions tab
   - Find the "Publish Chrome Extension" workflow
   - Check the logs for any errors

4. **Verify in Chrome Web Store:**
   - Go to [Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard)
   - Check that a new draft version was uploaded

Have a great day! ðŸŒŸ
